META Repository for UDOO Yocto support based on "Dora" Yocto branch

The main steps are:

  * install the 'repo' utility
  * download the Freescale Yocto BSP source
  * apply the meta-ronga-udoo layer and enable it
  * build your desired image


Install the `repo` utility:

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir fsl-community-bsp
$: cd fsl-community-bsp
$: repo init -u https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform -b dora
$: repo sync

Download the meta-ronga-udoo layer:

$: cd sources
$: git clone https://github.com/rongals/meta-ronga-udoo
$: cd ..

Prepare the environment for the build. If you have an UDOO Dual board,
run:

$: export MACHINE="udoo-dual"

If you have an UDOO Quad board, run:

$: export MACHINE="udoo-quad"

Then run:

$: source ./setup-environment build

Then enable the new layer by editing the file "build/conf/bblayers.conf" 
and change the section

  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm-extra \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-demos \

into 

  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-arm-extra \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-ronga-udoo \
  ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-fsl-demos \


Once this has complete, you will have all you need. To start a build, do:

$: bitbake core-image-minimal

The deployed images are found (starting from the build directory) in:

 tmp/deploy/images/$MACHINE

You can directly burn your sdcard with:

$: dd if=core-image-minimal-${MACHINE}.sdcard of=/dev/yourSdCard bs=1M

---

A more complete image with Qt4 can be built using

$: MACHINE="udoo-quad" source ./setup-environment build
$: bitbake fsl-core-gui

(and grab 10-15 coffes)
